BookBuddy Alpha v0.3

Developed 19 December 2021 - 28 December 2021

This is an book categorization program mostly used to experiment with the concepts of command line interfaces
and databases. It is no longer being supported, and instead BookBuddy Beta is the current working version with
a GUI and improved features.

To Do:
 * Add user accounts [DONE]
 * Improve Modularity [DONE]
 * Add database saving support [DONE]
 * Add GUI functionality [BETA FEATURE]

 Known Bugs:
 * Quitting after logging out will give a "not logged in" message
    * This is due to the user account logging itself out as soon as the user quits
    to the OS.

 It should be noted that the security of this software is currently non-existent. Passwords are stored
 in plaintext, and all databases are easily mutable and truncatable.

 And no, I don't plan on improving the documentation.

 *Run Main.py to start.*
